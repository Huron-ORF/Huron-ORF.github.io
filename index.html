  <h2 class="about-h2"> Project's Vision </h2>
  <p style = "font-size: initial;"> Our goal is to integrate artificial intelligence in developing infrastructure and work-flows for digital diagnostic pathology, facilitating transformational changes in the detection and treatment of disease, improving patient safety, and thus promoting sustainability of the Ontario health system. </p>
</div>

<div class="user-details">
  <h2 class="about-h2">Spotlight on Research: Using AI for Digital Pathology</h2>
  <p style = "font-size: initial; text-align: justify;"> 
    A university-industry-government partnership is developing new 
    <strong>artificial intelligence/machine learning tools</strong> 
    for the next generation of digital pathology scanners. 
    The project aims to revolutionize pathology infrastructure in Ontario hospitals, 
    facilitating transformational changes in the detection and treatment of disease, improving patient safety, 
    and promoting sustainability of the Ontario health system.
  </p>>

  <p style = "font-size: initial; text-align: justify;">The project has three main research objectives:</p>
  <p style = "font-size: initial; text-align: justify;">
    <ol style = "font-size: initial; text-align: justify;">
      <li>
        <strong>Creation of an open, flexible, and comprehensive digital pathology database</strong> 
        using AI-empowered annotating workflow to scale up and enlarge UofT's currently available database. 
        The database will cover a diverse spectrum of gastrointestinal and neuropathological organs 
        and will be used to learn the visual representation of histological and histopathological components 
        of organs.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Research, development, validation, and deployment of efficient and customizable convolution neural networks (CNNs)</strong> 
        to classify tissue patches extracted from WSI as being histological or histopathological tissue organs. 
        This will allow the development of an AI-based, automated slide-level screening technology, 
        which will alleviate the burden of long turnaround time for test reports and significantly reduce lengthy hospital stays.
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Creation and development of an AI-powered, efficient, and universal disease diagnosing system</strong> 
        that can classify types and levels of diseases, identify clinically relevant organ information, 
        and generate relevant patient statistics reports. A preliminary diagnosis will be rendered by ScannerAI 
        to be validated by the attending pathologists.</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p style = "font-size: initial; text-align: justify;">
    The project's thorough validation will take place at 
    <strong>St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto and Toronto General Hospital/Research Institute (UHN)</strong>. 
    Commercial and social benefits are expected to accrue from the scanning systems and software products developed. 
    <strong>Huron Digital Pathology</strong> will provide the means for developing, commercializing, and applying the research outcomes.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            This government-funded project on transforming digital pathology with AI is led 
            by a team of scientists and physicians from the University of Toronto, 
            industry partner Huron Digital Pathology, University of Waterloo, Queens University, and government partners. 
            The project will also recruit students and associates to work on the project. 
            The team's expertise in pathology, machine learning, and computer engineering will 
            allow them to create a comprehensive digital pathology database, 
            develop efficient neural networks, and create an AI-powered diagnosing system. 
            The validation of the project will take place at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto 
            and Toronto General Hospital/Research Institute (UHN). 
            The commercial and social benefits from this project will be enormous, 
            as it will provide accurate, faster, 
            and cost-effective healthcare decisions regarding diagnosis and treatment at Ontario hospitals.

                            Andreas Moshovos along with his students has been answering the question 
                            “what is the best possible digital computation structure to solve problem X or to run application Y?” 
                            where “best” is a characteristic (or combination thereof) such as power, cost, complexity, etc. 
                            Much of his work has been on high-performance processor and memory system design and it has influenced commercial designs. 
                            Andreas Moshovos has received the Ptyhio and a Master’s in Computer Science from the University of Crete in 1990 and 1992 
                            and the PhD degree in Computer Sciences from the University of Wisconsin-Madison in 1998. He has taught Computer Design at Northwestern University, 
                            USA, (Assistant Professor 1998-2000), the Ecole Polytechnique de Laussane, Switzerland, (Invited Professor 2011) 
                            and since 2000 at the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department of the University of Toronto where he now is a professor.

    <h3> <strong>Theme 1. Scaling-up the ADP Database</strong> </h3>
    <ul>
      <li> 1.1	Glass Slide Selection </li>
      <li> 1.2 Conversion of Glass Slides into Digital Slides </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rigorous clinical validation will require presenting the ADP database 
      and diagnostic tools with a large sample of slides representing a range of normal and diseased states. 
      St. Michael's Hospital (SMH) and University Health Network (UHN) will provide a total of 180,000 slides 
      for the completion of this project in five years. 
      The breakdown of the slides will be 130,000 slides from GI and 50,000 slides from Brain. 
      The GI slides will include 22,000 normal anatomy and 108,000 disease slides across diverse organs, 
      i.e. colon, small intestine, stomach, and esophagus. 
      The diseased slides will contain diverse inflammatory and neoplastic diseases. 
      All slides will be hematoxylin and eosin-stained slides of biopsy specimens retrieved 
      from the archives of the Division of Pathology at the SMH. 
      The Brain slides will include 8,000 normal and 42,000 disease slides 
      across diverse regions of the central nervous system including cortical and cerebellar gray and white matter, 
      brain stem, spinal cord and peripheral nerve.

    <h3> <strong>Theme 2. Development, Enhancement and Build-up of the AI Engine - Histonet </strong></h3>
    <ul>
      <li> 2.1	Active Histology Learning</li>
      <li> 2.2	HistoNet Architecture Development</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The challenge is to create a comprehensive ADP covering a broad spectrum of organs and tissues in a relative short period of time, 
      a process that is manually intensive requiring experts (pathologists) time for annotation that is expensive and not readily available.
      We then plan to introduce a new methodology to incrementally collect, annotate 
      and validate a comprehensive ADP database that can cover broad spectrum of GI and Neuro histology organs for supervised learning.
      The annotation workflow is empowered by HistoNet (trained on each data collection trial) 
      to facilitate the validation process throughout a seamless interaction between our engineering and pathologists' teams. 
      The WSI scans acquired with the Huron TissueScope brightfield scanner are divided into smaller image patches 
      where a selective procedure is applied via HistoNet (a pre-trained CNN classifier) to predict the possible tissue types that exist in a patch, 
      where each patch along its predicted labels is provided to an expert pathologist to review/edit the labels. 
      Once a certain batch of image patches are revised, 
      they will be augmented to the existing ADP and the HistoNet training will be further fine-tuned accordingly.
